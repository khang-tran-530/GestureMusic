# GestureMusic 🎶

GestureMusic is a **web-based computer vision project** that uses **real-time hand tracking** to browse a library of album covers through intuitive gestures. By mapping natural hand movement to UI controls, the project explores **gesture-based interaction** as an alternative to traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard.

## Tech Stack
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)**
- **Vite** (local dev server + build tooling)
- **MediaPipe Tasks Vision (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision`)** for hand tracking (Web/WASM)
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Canvas** overlay for drawing hand landmarks
